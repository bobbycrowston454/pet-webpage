    <img src="img/mendocino.jpg" alt="Picture of Mendocino, CA">
    <p>Mendocino California is a rugged and isolated place. I love the cliffs and the tempestuous waves. The smell of the sea in the air is refeshing and enlivening. I very much enjoyed my stay there. Although, the one night we spent in the hotel there was a very drunk woman in the lobby talking about England and she was very annoying.</p>
